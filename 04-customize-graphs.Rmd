# CUSTOMIZING GRAPHS IN BASE R

## Introduction
The main objectives of this chapter are:

- Learn to customize and enhance graphs using Râ€™s base graphic parameters.
- Understand how to apply visual enhancements to convey information more
effectively.


## Graph Customization Basics
Customizing plots in R allows you to enhance the appearance and readability of the visualizations. The **par()** function in R is used to set or query graphical parameters. 

**i). Graphical Parameters (par())**

- **pch:** Sets the plotting symbol (or point character) used in plotting functions like **plot()**.
- **lty:** Sets the line type.
- **lwd:** Sets the line width.
- **col:** Sets the color of lines and points.
- **bg:** Sets the background color.
- **cex:** Sets the character size.
- **mar:** Sets the margins of the plot.


**ii). Adding Custom Colors, Line Types, Point Shapes, and Plot Characters**

- **Custom Colors:** You can specify custom colors using color names, hexadecimal codes, or color numbers.
- **Line Types:** Different line types are available, such as solid, dashed, dotted, etc.
- **Point Shapes:** Various point shapes are available, including circles, squares, triangles, etc.
- **Plot Characters:** Different plot characters, such as dots, crosses, stars, etc., can be used.


**Example:**

```{r}
# Sample data
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2

# Plot with customized graphical parameters
par(
  pch = 19,    # Use solid circles for points
  lty = 2,     # Use dashed line
  lwd = 2,     # Set line width to 2
  col = "blue" # Set line and point color to blue
)

plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Customized Plot", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
points(x, y, col = "red") # Add points with red color

```


## Enhancing Plot Aesthetics
Improving the aesthetics of plots is essential for effectively communicating your data. The following  are some techniques for enhancing plot aesthetics in R:

1. Setting Axis Options:

Axis Labels: Use xlab and ylab parameters to set labels for x and y axes, respectively.
Tick Marks: Use axes = FALSE to remove axis tick marks and add them back using axis() function.
Axis Limits: Use xlim and ylim parameters to set limits for the x and y axes, respectively.
