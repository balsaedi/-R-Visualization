It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and it is highly extensible. R is freely available and runs on all major platforms, making it an excellent choice for data analysis and visualization. With its extensive libraries, R enables users to manipulate data, conduct statistical analyses, and create visualizations to explore and communicate insights effectively. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced data scientist, R provides a flexible and comprehensive environment for all your data analysis needs. 1.2 Why Use R for Data Visualization? 1.2.1 Advantages of R over other programming languages and tools R has thousands of packages, designed, maintained, and widely used by statisticians. The R graphs have much more fun compared to other tools such as STATA. R has a rather liberal syntax, and variables don’t need to be declared as they would in (for example) C++, which makes it very easy to code in. R is designed to make it very easy to write functions which are applied point wise to every element of a vector. This is extremely useful in statistics. R is powerful: if a command doesn’t exist already, you can code it yourself. 1.2.2 R’s extensive package ecosystem A package is a collection (or library) of functions, datasets, and other objects. Most packages are not loaded automatically, so you have to do it yourself. R’s extensive package ecosystem provides a vast array of tools for data analysis and visualization. These packages are contributed by a vibrant community of developers and cover almost every aspect of data science. Some of the most popular visualization packages include: ggplot2: The package provides an intuitive syntax for creating complex and beautiful visualizations. plotly: This package allows one to create interactive web-based visualizations directly from R. ggvis: It allows the creation of web-based visualizations with reactive features using the grammar of graphics syntax. lattice: It is particularly useful for creating trellis plots, which allow you to visualize relationships in multivariate data. gganimate: The package allows you to easily add animations to your visualizations, making it ideal for exploring changes in data over time. In this course, we will focus on the base R graphics system, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how plots are constructed in R. Once you have a good grasp of the basics, you can easily transition to more specialized packages like ggplot2 and plotly to create even more sophisticated visualizations. 1.3 Installing and Configuring R and RStudio Before installing RStudio in your computer, first start with R. RStudio is a front end program that lets you write R code, view plots, and do many other useful things. The detailed steps below show how to install R and RStudio in your computer system on both Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. 1.3.1 Step-by-step guide on installing R Download the R installer from https://cran.r-project.org/. a). Click on the link for your operating system. Make sure the installer is for the latest R version. For example, the latest version is 4.3.3. b). Click install R for the first time. c). Use the download link at the top and save the file. Run the installer (double click), default settings are fine. 1.3.2 Step-by-step guide on installing RStudio and Set Up Wait until the R installer has finished. 2.Download RStudio installer from the official website https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. After the download is complete, double-click on the installer and follow the installation steps to install it in your computer. After successful installation, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking the RStudio icon on your desktop or from the Start menu. You can install the packages using the install.packages() function. However, for the base R visualization, you don’t need to install any package which will support in plotting of graphs except where we you will be required to use data that comes with R packages. The last set up may be setting your working directory to the folder where your R scripts and data files are located. This makes it easier to access your files but it is optional. 1.4 Basic R Concepts. 1.4.1 Introduction to R syntax and basic commands R is designed for statistical computing and graphics. In this section, we will cover some basic syntax and commands to help you get started with R. 1. R as a Calculator: You can use R as a simple calculator. Here are some basic arithmetic operations: # Addition 2 + 3 ## [1] 5 # Subtraction 5 - 2 ## [1] 3 # Multiplication 2 * 3 ## [1] 6 # Division 6 / 2 ## [1] 3 # Exponentiation 2^3 ## [1] 8 Your turn! Add 35 to 65. Subtract 70 from 200. Multiply 6 by 8, divide 65 by 5 and lastly raise 9 to the power of 10. # Add 35 to 65. # Subtract 70 from 200. # Multiply 6 by 8 # Divide 65 by 5 # Raise 9 to the power of 10. # Addition 35+65 ## [1] 100 # Subtraction 100 - 70 ## [1] 30 # Multiplication 6 * 8 ## [1] 48 # Division 65 / 5 ## [1] 13 # Exponentiation 9^10 ## [1] 3486784401 2. Assigning Values to Variables: You can store values in variables using the assignment operator &lt;- or =. # Assigning a value to a variable x &lt;- 5 y &lt;- 3 # You can also use = z = x + y Try to assign 10 to a variable called m and 89 to a variable called n. Create a new variable called p which is the sum of m and n.  # Write your code here # Print p m&lt;-10 n&lt;-89 p&lt;-m+n #Print p p ## [1] 99 If you did it right, the final answer should be 99. 3. Basic Data Types: R supports several basic data types, including numeric, character, logical, and complex. # Numeric num &lt;- 10 # Character char &lt;- &quot;Hello, Basim!&quot; # Logical logic &lt;- TRUE # Complex comp &lt;- 3 + 2i 4. Vectors: A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. You can create a vector using the c() function. # Creating a numeric vector nums &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Creating a character vector chars &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) nums ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 chars ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;orange&quot; 5. Indexing and Slicing: You can access elements of a vector using square brackets []. # Accessing elements of a vector nums &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 45,78) nums[1] # Access the first element of nums ## [1] 1 nums[2:4] # Access the second to fourth elements of nums ## [1] 2 3 4 nums[6] # Access the sixth element of nums ## [1] 9 Write a sequence of numbers from 2 to 1000 that increase by 17 and store them in a vector called seq. Access the 15th number. What do you get? # Your code # Print the 15th number # Generate the sequence seq &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 1000, by = 17) # Access the 15th number number_15 &lt;- seq[15] # Print the 15th number print(number_15) ## [1] 240 The correct answer should be 240. 6. Functions: R has a large number of built-in functions, and you can also create your own functions for some tasks that can not be achieved by built-in functions. # Built-in function sqrt(16) # Square root function ## [1] 4 nums &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) mean(nums) # the mean of nums elements ## [1] 3 var(nums) # the variance ## [1] 2.5 sd(nums) # standard deviation ## [1] 1.581139 # User-defined function add &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a + b) } add(3, 5) ## [1] 8 Define your own function called perform_operation to perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication with three arguments (x,y,operation). Ensure that the function prints the result or returns an error in a division by zero and print the error message, “Error: Division by zero”. # Define your function called perform_operation here with three arguments (x,y,operation). #Test the function x&lt;-10 y&lt;-5 # Addition perform_operation(x, y, &quot;addition&quot;) ## Error in perform_operation(x, y, &quot;addition&quot;): could not find function &quot;perform_operation&quot; # Subtraction perform_operation(x, y, &quot;subtraction&quot;) ## Error in perform_operation(x, y, &quot;subtraction&quot;): could not find function &quot;perform_operation&quot; # Multiplication perform_operation(x, y, &quot;multiplication&quot;) ## Error in perform_operation(x, y, &quot;multiplication&quot;): could not find function &quot;perform_operation&quot; # Division perform_operation(x, y, &quot;division&quot;) ## Error in perform_operation(x, y, &quot;division&quot;): could not find function &quot;perform_operation&quot; # Define a function for basic mathematical operations perform_operation &lt;- function(x, y, operation) { result &lt;- switch(operation, &quot;addition&quot; = x + y, &quot;subtraction&quot; = x - y, &quot;multiplication&quot; = x * y, &quot;division&quot; = if(y != 0) x / y else &quot;Error: Division by zero&quot;) print(result) } # Test the function x &lt;- 10 y &lt;- 5 # Addition perform_operation(x, y, &quot;addition&quot;) ## [1] 15 # Subtraction perform_operation(x, y, &quot;subtraction&quot;) ## [1] 5 # Multiplication perform_operation(x, y, &quot;multiplication&quot;) ## [1] 50 # Division perform_operation(x, y, &quot;division&quot;) ## [1] 2 1.4.2 Overview of R’s data types and structures essential for visualization R provides several data types and structures that are essential for data visualization. Understanding these data types and structures is crucial for effectively analyzing and visualizing data. 1.

Integer: Integer data type is used to represent integer values. int &lt;- 10L int ## [1] 10 3. Character: Character data type is used to represent text data. char &lt;- &quot;Hi, John!&quot; char ## [1] &quot;Hi, John!&quot; 4. Logical: Logical data type is used to represent Boolean values ( TRUE or FALSE). logic &lt;- TRUE logic ## [1] TRUE 5. Vector: A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. It is created using the concatenate c() command. nums &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # A vector of numeric data type chars &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) # A vector of character data type 6. Matrix: A matrix is a two-dimensional array with rows and columns in that order respectively, that is (\\(R \\times C\\) ). It is created using the matrix() command. mat &lt;- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4) # A matrix with three rows and 2 columns mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 4 7 10 ## [2,] 2 5 8 11 ## [3,] 3 6 9 12 7. Data Frame: A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. It can contain several data types. It is created using the command data.frame() command. df &lt;- data.frame( Name = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;), Age = c(25, 30, 35), Height = c(175, 160, 180) ) df ## Name Age Height ## 1 John 25 175 ## 2 Alice 30 160 ## 3 Bob 35 180 8. List: A list is an ordered collection of objects (which may be of different types: numeric, character, etc.). It is created using the list() command. lst &lt;- list( Name = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;), Age = c(25, 30, 35), Height = c(175, 160, 180) ) lst ## $Name ## [1] &quot;John&quot; &quot;Alice&quot; &quot;Bob&quot; ## ## $Age ## [1] 25 30 35 ## ## $Height ## [1] 175 160 180 9.

Merge the two data frames using rbind(). Try sorting the titles using sort(): what happens? #Your code Exercise 5: Factors and Simple plot Suppose we have the heights of 100 individuals, where the first are 50 male and the rest female. Generate 100 fixed random numbers from a normal distribution where the mean height of male is 170 while that of female is 160 with an equal standard deviation of 10 and call that vector as ‘height’. Create another vector called ‘sex’ with two entries ‘M’ and ‘F’ each replicated 50 times. Tell R to treat ‘sex’ as a categorical variable and name it as ‘Sex’. Plot Sex against height using plot() function. Which type of plot have you obtained? What happens if you try to plot sex against height instead? #Your code "],["r-base-graphics---starting-with-the-basics.html", "Chapter 2 R BASE GRAPHICS - STARTING WITH THE BASICS 2.1 Exploring Base Graphics in R 2.2 Creating Basic Plots 2.3 Customizing Plots 2.4 Practical Examples: Exercises", " Chapter 2 R BASE GRAPHICS - STARTING WITH THE BASICS 2.1 Exploring Base Graphics in R 2.1.1 Overview of the philosophy behind R’s base graphics system, including its stateful nature 2.1.1.1 Stateful Nature R’s base graphics system is stateful, meaning that plots are built up incrementally. You start with an empty plot and add elements to it one by one. This is in contrast to systems like ggplot2, which use a declarative approach where you specify the plot all at once. Stateful nature means that every new plotting command modifies the existing plot or creates a new one if none exists. This allows for a high degree of flexibility but can sometimes lead to complex and intuitive behavior. R’s base graphics system provides a set of low-level graphics primitives for creating plots. These primitives include functions for drawing points, lines, polygons, text, and more. By combining these primitives, you can create a wide variety of plots, from simple scatter plots to complex multi-panel layouts. 2.1.1.2 Philosophy The philosophy behind R’s base graphics system is to provide a flexible and powerful tool for creating a wide range of plots. The emphasis is on simplicity and ease of use, making it easy for users to quickly create informative visualizations. However, despite that base graphics are powerful, they do have some limitations compared to more modern plotting systems like ggplot2. For instance, they lack some of the advanced features of ggplot2, such as automatic faceting and easy customization of plot themes. 2.1.2 Introduction to Core Plotting Functions in R R provides a variety of core plotting functions that are useful for creating basic visualizations. In this section, we will explore some of the most commonly used plotting functions. The commonly used core plotting functions are plot(), hist(), boxplot() and barplot(). The plot() function is used to create scatter plots, line plots, and other types of plots. It is a versatile function that can be used to visualize relationships between two or more variables. The hist() function is used to create histograms, which are used to visualize the distribution of a single numeric variable. Note that the optional argument breaks chooses (approximately) how many bins the histogram should have, and col alters the colour of the bars. The boxplot() function is used to create box plots, which are used to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable, optionally broken down by a categorical variable. The barplot() function is used to create bar plots, which are used to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. 2.2 Creating Basic Plots 2.2.1 Detailed instructions on using plot() for scatter plots and line graphs In order to get the full documentation of the plot() function, run ?plot in R. The syntax for the function is given below. # plot(x, y = NULL, type = &quot;p&quot;, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, # log = &quot;&quot;, main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, # ann = par(&quot;ann&quot;), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes, # panel.first = NULL, panel.last = NULL, asp = NA, # xgap.axis = NA, ygap.axis = NA, # ...) Arguments \\(x, y\\): the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) arguments provide the x and y coordinates for the plot. \\(type\\): 1-character string giving the type of plot desired.”p” for points, “l” for lines “b” for both points and lines, “c” for empty points joined by lines, “o” for overplotted points and lines, “s” and “S” for stair steps and “h” for histogram-like vertical lines. Finally, “n” does not produce any points or lines. \\(xlim,\\quad ylim\\): the x and y limits respectively. \\(log\\): a character string which contains “x” if the x axis is to be logarithmic, “y” if the y axis is to be logarithmic and “xy” or “yx” if both axes are to be logarithmic. \\(main\\) : a main title for the plot. \\(sub\\): a subtitle for the plot. \\(xlab,\\quad ylab\\) : The labels for x-axis and y-axis respectively, defaults to a description of x and y. The commonly used graphical parameters are: \\(col\\) : The colors for lines and points. Multiple colors can be specified so that each point can be given its own color. If there are fewer colors than points they are recycled in the standard fashion. Lines will all be plotted in the first colour specified. \\(bg\\) : a vector of background colors for open plot symbols \\(pch\\): a vector of plotting characters or symbols \\(cex\\) : a numerical vector giving the amount by which plotting characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. \\(lty\\): a vector of line types \\(lwd\\): a vector of line widths Example: # Create a scatter plot x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) plot(x, y, type = &quot;p&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, pch = 16, main = &quot;Scatter Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y&quot;) # Create a line plot plot(x, y, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 1, main = &quot;Line plot&quot;, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL) 2.2.2 Using hist() to create histograms for data distribution analysis Histograms are useful for visualizing the frequency distribution of a single variable. Similarly, you can get more documentation of the hist() function by running the command ?hist in R. The generic function hist computes a histogram of the given data values.The default behavior for a histogram is to display frequencies on the vertical axis; probability densities can be displayed using the freq=FALSE option. The default title is given by paste(“Histogram of” , x) where x is the name of the variable being plotted; this can be changed with the main option. The common syntax for the function is given below #hist(x, breaks = &quot;Sturges&quot;, # freq = NULL, probability = !freq, # include.lowest = TRUE, right = TRUE, fuzz = 1e-7, # density = NULL, angle = 45, col = &quot;lightgray&quot;, border = NULL, # main = paste(&quot;Histogram of&quot; , xname), # xlim = range(breaks), ylim = NULL, # xlab = xname, ylab, # axes = TRUE, plot = TRUE, labels = FALSE, # nclass = NULL, warn.unused = TRUE, ...) # Create a histogram set.seed(100) # Fix the random numbers generated data &lt;- rnorm(100) # Generate some random data hist(data, breaks = &quot;Sturges&quot;, col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram&quot;, xlab = &quot;Value&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;) 2.2.3 Implementing boxplot() and barplot() to visualize data comparisons and distributions The boxplot() and barplot() functions in R are commonly used for visualizing data comparisons and distributions. 1. boxplot() The common syntax of the function is given below. #boxplot(x, data = NULL, col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, main = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = #NULL) Example # Create a box plot data &lt;- data.frame( Group = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), each = 50), Value = c(rnorm(50), rnorm(50, mean = 2), rnorm(50, mean = 3)) ) boxplot(Value ~ Group, data = data, col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, main = &quot;Box Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;Group&quot;, ylab = &quot;Value&quot;) 2.barplot() The syntax used for barplot() function is given below. #barplot(x, names.arg = NULL, col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, main = NULL, xlab = NULL, #ylab = NULL) Example # Create a bar plot data &lt;- table(mtcars$cyl) barplot(data, col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, main = &quot;Bar Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Cylinders&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;) 2.3 Customizing Plots 2.3.1 Basic customization options including colors, main titles, axis labels, and plot dimensions 1. Changing Colors # Create a scatter plot with custom colors x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) plot(x, y, type = &quot;p&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16, main = &quot;&quot;, xlab = &quot;X&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y&quot;) 2. Adding Titles and Axis Labels # Create a scatter plot with titles and axis labels x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) plot(x, y, type = &quot;p&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16, main = &quot;Scatter Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X-axis&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y-axis&quot;) 3. Changing Plot Dimensions # Create a scatter plot with custom dimensions x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) plot(x, y, type = &quot;p&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16, main = &quot;Scatter Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y&quot;, xlim = c(0, 6), ylim = c(0, 12)) 4. Combining Customization Options # Create a scatter plot with custom colors, titles, axis labels, and dimensions x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) y &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) plot(x, y, type = &quot;p&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16, main = &quot;Scatter Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X-axis&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y-axis&quot;, xlim = c(0, 6), ylim = c(0, 12)) You can further customize your plots by adjusting parameters such as pch (for points), lwd (for lines), lty (for line type), cex (for point size), and more. 2.3.2 Tips on enhancing plot readability and aesthetic appeal In order to have a plot with enhanced readability and have an aesthetic appeal, you need to use some of these tips: Choose appropriate colors: Use colors that complement each other and make it easy to distinguish different elements of the plot.Avoid using colors that are too bright or too similar to each other. Use appropriate font sizes and styles: Use larger font sizes for titles and axis labels to make them more prominent. Add grid lines: Adding grid lines can make it easier to read the plot and interpret the data. Use appropriate plot types: Choose the appropriate plot type for your data. For example, use a scatter plot for continuous data and a bar plot for categorical data. Use consistent and intuitive labeling: Make sure that the labels on your plot are consistent and intuitive, making it easy for readers to understand the information presented. Use legends for clarity: Use legends to explain the meaning of different colors or symbols used in the plot. You can also add more improvements to your plot to make it look more nice and appealing. 2.4 Practical Examples: Exercises Exercise 6 Create a dataframe of marks of 1000 students (male and female) with their respective status i.e pass if marks &gt;= 40, fail otherwise (set a seed to 100). Additionally, let the student marks be graded using factor method in the following format: A: 70 marks and above B: 60-69 C: 50-59 D: 40-49 E: Below 40 marks Create a dataframe called students with the vectors; id, gender, marks, grade and status where status is a column which shows whether the student passed or failed.You will use this dataframe to answer exercise 7,8 and 9.Note: The minimum mark should be 10 marks # Your code Exercise 7 Plot a box plot to show the distribution of marks by gender.Give it a title, ‘Distribution of Student Marks’. The x-axis should be labelled as ‘Gender’ while the y-axis should be labelled as ‘Marks’. Apply blue color to male and green color to female. Set cex.main and cex.lab to 1.2. #Your code Exercise 8 Plot a histogram of the marks where the bins should be equivalent to the classes of grading. Which grade had the highest number of students? How were the marks distributed in the class? Fill the histogram with red. Add a customized title and label the axes. #Your code Exercise 9 Use a well customized barpot to show the mean mark of students by gender.

Understanding data structures is crucial for creating effective visualizations in R. Properly organizing and structuring your data allows you to generate clear and insightful visual outputs. In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of data structure understanding in achieving effective visualizations. 3.1.1 Importance of Data Structure Understanding Data Compatibility: Different types of visualizations require different data structures. Understanding how to structure your data properly ensures compatibility with the visualization techniques you want to use. Efficient Data Handling: Well-structured data is easier to manipulate and process, leading to more efficient visualization workflows. Insightful Visual Outputs: Properly structured data enables you to generate visual outputs that effectively communicate your insights and findings. The most commonly used data structures for visualization are vectors, matrices, data frames and lists. 3.2 Vectors, Data Frames, and Matrices 3.2.1 Definitions Vectors are one-dimensional arrays that can hold numeric, character, or logical values. They are suitable for creating simple plots like scatter plots and line graphs. For example, a vector of numeric values can be used to represent data on the x or y-axis of a plot. A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure where columns can be of different types. Data frames are highly versatile and commonly used for data analysis and visualization. They are suitable for creating a wide range of visualizations, including bar plots, histograms, and box plots. Each column in a data frame can represent a different variable, making it easy to visualize relationships between variables. Matrices are two-dimensional arrays that contain elements of the same atomic types. Matrices are useful for creating visualizations such as heatmaps and surface plots. They are suitable for representing data that has two dimensions, such as images or spatial data. Lists are ordered collections of objects, which can be of different types. Lists can also be nested, allowing for complex data structures. They provide flexibility in organizing and storing data for complex visualizations. They are suitable for creating custom plots or combining multiple plots into a single visualization. Factors are used to represent categorical data in R.

Understand how to apply visual enhancements to convey information more effectively. 4.2 Graph Customization Basics Customizing plots in R allows you to enhance the appearance and readability of the visualizations. The par() function in R is used to set or query graphical parameters. i). Graphical Parameters (par()) pch: Sets the plotting symbol (or point character) used in plotting functions like plot(). lty: Sets the line type. lwd: Sets the line width. col: Sets the color of lines and points. bg: Sets the background color. cex: Sets the character size. mar: Sets the margins of the plot. ii). Adding Custom Colors, Line Types, Point Shapes, and Plot Characters Custom Colors: You can specify custom colors using color names, hexadecimal codes, or color numbers. Line Types: Different line types are available, such as solid, dashed, dotted, etc. Point Shapes: Various point shapes are available, including circles, squares, triangles, etc. Plot Characters: Different plot characters, such as dots, crosses, stars, etc., can be used. Example: # Sample data x &lt;- 1:10 y &lt;- x^2 # Plot with customized graphical parameters par( pch = 19, # Use solid circles for points lty = 2, # Use dashed line lwd = 2, # Set line width to 2 col = &quot;blue&quot; # Set line and point color to blue ) plot(x, y, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;Customized Plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y&quot;) points(x, y, col = &quot;red&quot;) # Add points with red color 4.3 Enhancing Plot Aesthetics Improving the aesthetics of plots is essential for effectively communicating your data. The following are some techniques for enhancing plot aesthetics in R: 1. Setting Axis Options: Axis Labels: Use xlab and ylab parameters to set labels for x and y axes, respectively. Tick Marks: Use axes = FALSE to remove axis tick marks and add them back using axis() function. Axis Limits: Use xlim and ylim parameters to set limits for the x and y axes, respectively. Example: # Sample data x &lt;- 1:10 y &lt;- x^2 # Plot with customized axis options plot(x, y, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;A simple line plot&quot;, xlab = &quot;X-axis&quot;, ylab = &quot;Y-axis&quot;, xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 120)) axis(side = 1, at = seq(0, 12, by = 2)) # Add x-axis tick marks axis(side = 2, at = seq(0, 120, by = 20)) # Add y-axis tick marks 4.4 Advanced Customization Techniques Enhancing plots in R involves more than just changing colors and labels. Here are some advanced customization techniques to make your plots more informative and visually appealing: i). Multiple Plot Windows (mfrow and mfcol): mfrow: Divides the plotting area into a matrix of rows and columns. Plots are filled row-wise. mfcol: Divides the plotting area into a matrix of rows and columns. Plots are filled column-wise. # Example using mfrow par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Create a 2x2 grid for plots plot(1:10, 1:10, main = &quot;Plot 1&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) plot(1:10, (1:10)^2, main = &quot;Plot 2&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) plot(1:10, (1:10)^3, main = &quot;Plot 3&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) plot(1:10, log(1:10), main = &quot;Plot 4&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) ii). Customizing Plots with Grid Lines, Background Color, and Themes: Grid Lines: Use grid() function to add grid lines to the plot. Background Color: Use par(bg = “color”) to set background color for the plot. Themes: Use themes from packages like ggplot2 to change the overall appearance of the plot. This will be covered under ggplot2 package chapter. Example with Grid Lines and Background Color: # Example with grid lines and background color plot(1:10, 1:10, main = &quot;A Customized Simple Line Plot&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab=&#39;Height&#39;,ylab = &#39;Weight&#39;) grid() # Add grid lines par(bg = &quot;lightblue&quot;) # Set background color 4.5 Practical Examples: Exercise Exercise 11 Read the cabbages dataset from MASS package. Remove the duplicated values of “HeadWt” and arrange the dataframe in descending order by “HeadWt” column. Plot a line plot of “HeadWt” against its square and apply blue color with the first line type. Add a second line plot of the square of cube of “HeadWt” , apply the red color and the line type should be the second one. Add a legend to the plot and position it at the top - left position with the names “Square of Head Weight” and “Cube of Head Weight” respectively. Maintain the same line types and colors that were used to plot. Add a title, ‘Comparison of Cabbage Trends’. Label the x-axis as ‘Head Weight’ and y-axis should be blank # Your code Exercise 12 : Multiple Small Plots in One Graphic to Compare Different Data Sets Create a vector x of a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. Create another vector y1 which is the square of x. Create another vector y2 which is the double of x. Lastly, create the last vector y3 which is equivalent to x raised to the power of 1.5. Create three multiple small line plots and organize them in one row with three columns. All plots will use the same independent variable in the x-axis, i.e x. Plot x against y1. Give it the title,‘Trend 1’, x-axis should be labelled as ‘X’ while y-axis=‘Y’ and color is blue. Plot x against y2. Give it the title,‘Trend 2’, x-axis should be labelled as ‘X’ while y-axis=‘Y2’,col is red. Plot x against y3.

The two main objectives of this chapter are: Understand specific considerations for plotting time series data in R. Learn to effectively visualize time-dependent data using R’s base graphics. 6.1.1 Importance of time series analysis in various fields like finance, meteorology, and epidemiology Time series analysis plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, meteorology, epidemiology, and many others. Understanding time series data and effectively visualizing it are essential for extracting meaningful insights. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of time series analysis and the challenges associated with visualizing time series data. Time series analysis is vital in various fields including: Finance: Analyzing stock prices, market trends, and forecasting. Meteorology: Studying weather patterns, climate change, and forecasting. Epidemiology: Tracking disease outbreaks, analyzing trends, and forecasting. 6.1.2 Basic concepts related to time series data and its visualization challenges. Time Series Data: Time series data consists of observations or measurements taken at different points in time. Temporal Patterns: Time series data often exhibits various temporal patterns such as trend, seasonality, and cycles. Visualization Challenges: Visualizing time series data poses challenges due to its temporal nature and the need to effectively represent temporal patterns. 6.2 Time Series Data Basics Time series data in R is commonly represented using the ts class. The time series object must have a Date or POSIXct/lt column and at least one numeric column. 6.2.1 Introduction to time series objects in R (ts class). The ts class in R is a basic time series object. It is suitable for regularly spaced time series data. Time series objects are created using the ts() function. Example: Creating a time series object # Sample time series data data &lt;- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30) time_series &lt;- ts(data) # View the time series object print(time_series) ## Time Series: ## Start = 1 ## End = 5 ## Frequency = 1 ## [1] 10 15 20 25 30 6.2.2 How to convert standard date formats into time series objects R provides several functions to convert standard date formats into time series objects, such as as.ts() and ts(). Example: Converting Standard Date Formats into Time Series Objects # Sample data with dates dates &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2022-01-01&quot;, &quot;2022-02-01&quot;, &quot;2022-03-01&quot;, &quot;2022-04-01&quot;, &quot;2022-05-01&quot;)) data &lt;- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30) # Create a time series object time_series &lt;- ts(data, start = c(as.POSIXlt(dates[1])$year + 1900, as.POSIXlt(dates[1])$mon + 1), frequency = 12) # View the time series object print(time_series) ## Jan Feb Mar Apr May ## 2022 10 15 20 25 30 In this example, start indicates the start of the time series, and frequency indicates the number of observations per unit of time. Here, frequency = 12 indicates monthly data. These are the basics of working with time series data objects in R. 6.3 Visualizing Time Series Let’s load and plot the USgas series, a ts object which is attached in the TSstudio package: library(TSstudio) data(USgas) ts_info(USgas) ## The USgas series is a ts object with 1 variable and 238 observations ## Frequency: 12 ## Start time: 2000 1 ## End time: 2019 10 6.3.1 Creating line plots for time series data Let us plot the USgas series using the base R plot() function. plot(USgas) 6.3.2 Techniques for highlighting trends, seasonality, and anomalies Trends: Use lines() function to overlay a trend line on the plot. Seasonality: Use seasonplot() function from the forecast package to visualize seasonal patterns. Anomalies: Use points() function to mark anomalies on the plot. Example: Let’s visualize the USgas time series data and highlight trends, seasonality, and anomalies: # Install and load the necessary packages library(TSstudio) library(forecast) # Load the USgas time series object data(&quot;USgas&quot;) # Convert the ts object into a data frame USgas_df &lt;- data.frame(year = time(USgas), production = as.numeric(USgas)) # Apply loess function trend &lt;- loess(production ~ year, data = USgas_df) # Extract the trend values trend_values &lt;- predict(trend) # Plot the USgas time series plot(USgas, main = &quot;US Gas Production Time Series&quot;, xlab = &quot;Year&quot;, ylab = &quot;Gas Production&quot;) # Add trend line #lines(time(USgas), trend_values, col = &quot;blue&quot;) # Visualize seasonal pattern seasonplot(USgas, col = &quot;green&quot;) # Identify anomalies anomalies &lt;- which(USgas &gt; mean(USgas) + 2 * sd(USgas) | USgas &lt; mean(USgas) - 2 * sd(USgas)) points(time(USgas)[anomalies], USgas[anomalies], col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16) 6.4 Advanced Time Series Visualization 6.4.1 Advance customization using ts_plot() function from plotly package The ts_plot is a wraper of the plotly package plotting functions for time series objects, therefore, the output of the ts_plot is a plotly object. Advance customization of the ts_plot output can be done with plotly’s layout function. For example, let’s re plot the USgas series and customize the background to black: library(TSstudio) library(plotly) ts_plot(USgas, title = &quot;US Monthly Natural Gas Consumption&quot;, Xtitle = &quot;Time&quot;, Ytitle = &quot;Billion Cubic Feet&quot;, color = &quot;pink&quot;, Xgrid = TRUE, Ygrid = TRUE) %&gt;% layout(paper_bgcolor = &quot;black&quot;, plot_bgcolor = &quot;black&quot;, font = list(color = &quot;white&quot;), yaxis = list(linecolor = &quot;#6b6b6b&quot;, zerolinecolor = &quot;#6b6b6b&quot;, gridcolor= &quot;#444444&quot;), xaxis = list(linecolor = &quot;#6b6b6b&quot;, zerolinecolor = &quot;#6b6b6b&quot;, gridcolor= &quot;#444444&quot;)) Note that the Xgrid and Ygrid arguments, when set to TRUE, add the corresponding X and Y grid lines. 6.4.2 Plotting multiple time series on a single graph for comparative analysis The plotting of a multiple time series object is straightforward. Let’s load the Coffee_Prices an mts object that represents the monthly prices of the Robusta and Arabica coffee prices (USD per Kg.): library(TSstudio) data(&quot;Coffee_Prices&quot;) ts_info(Coffee_Prices) ## The Coffee_Prices series is a mts object with 2 variables and 701 observations ## Frequency: 12 ## Start time: 1960 1 ## End time: 2018 5 ts_plot(Coffee_Prices, title = &quot;Comparison of Robusta and Arabica coffee prices&quot;) By default, the function will plot all the series in one plot. Plotting the different series on a separate plot can be done by setting the type argument to multiple: library(TSstudio) ts_plot(Coffee_Prices, title = &quot;Comparison of Robusta and Arabica coffee prices&quot;, type = &quot;multiple&quot;) Note that the color, Ytitle, and Xtitle arguments are not applicable when plotting multiple time series object. 6.5 Practical Examples: Exercises Exercise 13: Stock market data Obtain the daily closing prices for the last ten calendar years of S&amp;P 500 Index, Dow Jones, NASDAQ100 and Russell 2000 indices from Yahoo Finance using the appropriate R package such as tidyquant or quantmod. Prepare the data and clean it by removing any missing values. Plot a time series plot of the prices of these indices in one graph and use the plot to identify any economic trends among the indices. # Your code Exercise 14: Temperature Obtain the temperature data from an open source such as Weather data (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/in/ahmedabad/VAAH) for Ahmedabad which is located in Western India on the banks of River Sabarmati.

They combine a box plot with a kernel density plot. iii) QQ Plots (Quantile-Quantile Plots): QQ plots are used to assess if a dataset follows a particular distribution. They compare the quantiles of the dataset against the quantiles of a theoretical distribution. These statistical plots are invaluable tools for exploring and understanding the distribution of data. 7.3 Analyzing Distributions with Histograms and Density Plots: Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of numerical data. They group data into bins and display the frequency of observations in each bin.Density plots estimate the probability density function of the underlying data distribution. They provide a smooth representation of the distribution. 7.3.1 Techniques for creating and customizing histograms and density plots and best practices for displaying distribution characteristics.

If you have not installed the ggplot2 package in your computer, then installing the package for the first time is achieved by writing the code install.packages(“ggplot2”). Once, the package has successfully been installed, you can set up the environment to use it in your analysis by writing the code library(“ggplot2”). Alternatively, ggpot2 package can be loaded by loading the tidyverse package which comes while attached with several packages where ggplot2 is among them. 8.1.2 Basic syntax and components of ggplot2: aesthetics, geoms, and layers Aesthetics: Mapping data variables to visual properties. Geoms: Geometric objects that represent data points, lines, shapes, etc. Layers: Building plots by adding layers of graphics. 8.2 Creating Basic Plots with ggplot2 We are using the gapminder dataset that has been put into an R package by Bryan (2017) so we can load it with library(gapminder). The dataset includes 1704 observations (rows) of 6 variables (columns: country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap). country, continent, and year could be thought of as grouping variables, whereas lifeExp (life expectancy), pop (population), and gdpPercap (Gross Domestic Product per capita) are values. The years in this dataset span 1952 to 2007 with 5-year intervals (so a total of 12 different years). It includes 142 countries from 5 continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas, Oceania). You can check that all of the numbers quoted above are correct with these lines: library(tidyverse) library(gapminder) gapminder$year %&gt;% unique() ## [1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 gapminder$country %&gt;% n_distinct() ## [1] 142 gapminder$continent %&gt;% unique() ## [1] Asia Europe Africa Americas Oceania ## Levels: Africa Americas Asia Europe Oceania 8.2.1 Step-by-step instructions to create scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts using ggplot2 8.2.1.1 Scatter plots/bubble plots Let’s create a new shorter tibble called gapdata2007 that only includes data for the year 2007. Let’s ask ggplot() to draw a point for each observation by adding geom_point() # Filter only the year 2007 data gapdata2007 &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(year == 2007) #Plot a simple scatter plot gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() 8.2.1.2 Histograms A histogram displays the distribution of values within a continuous variable. In the example below, we are taking the life expectancy (aes(x = lifeExp)) and telling the histogram to count the observations up in “bins” of 10 years (geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) We can see that most countries in the world have a life expectancy of ~70-80 years (in 2007), and that the distribution of life expectancy globally is not normally distributed. Setting the binwidth is optional, using just geom_histogram() works well too - by default, it will divide the data into 30 bins. 8.2.1.3 Bar plots There are two geoms for making bar plots - geom_col() and geom_bar() and the examples below will illustrate when to use which one. In short: if your data is already summarised or includes values for y (height of the bars), use geom_col(). If, however, you want ggplot() to count up the number of rows in your dataset, use geom_bar(). For example, with patient-level data (each row is a patient) you’ll probably want to use geom_bar(), with data that is already somewhat aggregated, you’ll use geom_col(). There is no harm in trying one, and if it doesn’t work, trying the other. Let’s plot the life expectancies in 2007 in these three countries: gapdata2007 %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(&quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = country, y = lifeExp)) + geom_col() 8.2.1.4 Box plots Box plots are our go to method for quickly visualizing summary statistics of a continuous outcome variable (such as life expectancy in the gapminder dataset. Box plots include: the median (middle line in the box) inter-quartile range (IQR, top and bottom parts of the boxes - this is where 50% of your data is) whiskers (the black lines extending to the lowest and highest values that are still within 1.5*IQR) outliers (any observations out with the whiskers) Let’s pot the boxplots of life expectancies within each continent in year 2007 gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot() 8.2.1.5 Line plots/time series plots Let’s plot the life expectancy in the United Kingdom over time. gapdata &lt;- gapminder gapdata %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;United Kingdom&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line() 8.2.2 Introduction to adding layers, modifying aesthetics, and utilizing facets for multi-panel plots a) Adding layers Going back to the scatter plot (lifeExp vs gdpPercap), let’s use continent to give the points some colour. We can do this by adding colour = continent inside the aes():Let’s also add a regression line to the scatter plot gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; b) Modifying aesthetics This can be achieved by specifying further variables inside aes() or specifying aesthetics outside aes(). The main aesthetics (things we can see) are: x, y, colour, fill, shape, size, and any of these could appear inside or outside the aes() function. Variables (so columns of your dataset) have to be defined inside aes(). Whereas to apply a modification on everything, we can set an aesthetic to a constant value outside of aes(). gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + geom_point(shape = 1) c) Utilizing facets for multi-panel plots Faceting is a way to efficiently create the same plot for subgroups within the dataset. For example, we can separate each continent into its own facet by adding facet_wrap(~continent) to our plot: gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + geom_point(shape = 1) + facet_wrap(~continent) 8.3 Customizing Plots in ggplot2 8.3.1 Advanced customization techniques including themes, scales, and coordinate systems. a) Themes Changing themes involves changing the default background from grey to a white background. Some of the built-in ggplot themes are theme_bw(), theme_dark(), theme_minimal() and theme_classic(). We are adding theme_bw() (“background white”) to give the plot a different look. We have also divided the gdpPercap by 1000 (making the units “thousands of dollars per capita”). Note that you can apply calculations directly on ggplot variables (so how we’ve done x = gdpPercap/1000 here). This is how ggplot() works - you can build a plot by adding or modifying things one by one. gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap/1000, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + geom_point(shape = 1) + facet_wrap(~continent) + theme_bw() b) Scales gapminder %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, colour = continent)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~continent) + theme_bw() + scale_colour_brewer(palette = &quot;Paired&quot;) c) Coordinate systems # Flipped coordinate system gapdata2007 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + geom_point(shape = 1)+ coord_flip() + labs(title = &quot;Scatter Plot with Flipped Coordinate System&quot;, x = &quot;GDP Per Capita&quot;, y = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) + theme_bw() 8.3.2 Techniques for fine-tuning ggplot2 outputs to create publication-quality graphics # Publication-quality scatter plot ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) + labs(title = &quot;Publication-Quality Scatter Plot&quot;, x = &quot;Sepal Length&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Width&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = &quot;bold&quot;, hjust = 0.5), axis.title = element_text(size = 12), axis.text = element_text(size = 10), legend.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.text = element_text(size = 10) ) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;setosa&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot; = &quot;red&quot;)) 8.4 Practical Examples: Exercise Exercise 17 Obtain a global dataset on internet usage trends.You might find the dataset datasets from Kaggle.

Data Visualization with Base R Download the answers template via the link Base R Visualization Answers Template. Download the data file squid1.xlsx from Squid Data link and save it to your working directory. Open this file in Microsoft Excel and save it as a tab delimited file type. Name the file squid1.txt and save it to the working directory. These data were originally collected as part of a study published in Aquatic Living Resources1 in 2005. The aim of the study was to investigate the seasonal patterns of investment in somatic and reproductive tissues in the long finned squid Loligo forbesi caught in Scottish waters. Squid were caught monthly from December 1989 - July 1991 (month and year variables). After capture, each squid was given a unique specimen code, weighed (weight) and the sex determined (sex - only female squid are included here). The size of individuals was also measured as the dorsal mantle length (DML) and the mantle weight measured without internal organs (eviscerate.weight). The gonads were weighed (ovary.weight) along with the accessory reproductive organ (the nidamental gland, nid.weight, nid.length). Each individual was also assigned a categorical measure of maturity (maturity.stage, ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 = immature, 5 = mature). The digestive gland weight (dig.weight) was also recorded to assess nutritional status of the individual. Import the ‘squid1.txt’ file into R using the read.table() function and assign it to a variable named squid. Use the str() function to display the structure of the dataset and the summary() function to summarise the dataset. How many observations are in this dataset? How many variables? The year, month and maturity.stage variables were coded as integers in the original dataset. Here we would like to code them as factors. Create a new variable for each of these variables in the squid dataframe and recode them as factors. Use the str() function again to check the coding of these new variables. How many observations are there per month and year combination (hint: remember the table() or xtabs() functions?)? Don’t forget to use the factor recoded versions of these variables. Do you have data for each month in each year? Which years have the most observations? (optional) Use a combination of the xtabs() and ftable() functions to create a flattened table of the number of observations for each year, maturity stage and month (aka a contingency table). The humble cleveland dotplot is a great way of identifying if you have potential outliers in continuous variables. Create dotplots (using the dotchart() function) for the following variables; DML, weight, nid.length and ovary.weight. Do these variables contain any unusually large or small observations? Don’t forget, if you prefer to create a single figure with all 4 plots you can always split your plotting device into 2 rows and 2 columns . Use the pdf() function to save a pdf version of your plot(s) in your output directory you created . You may also include some alternative code in the solutions for this exercise using the dotplot() function from the lattice package. It looks like the variable nid.length contains an unusually large value. Actually, this value is biologically implausible and clearly an error. The researchers were asked to go back and check their field notebooks and sure enough they discover a typo. It looks like a tired researcher accidentally inserted a zero by mistake when transcribing these data (mistakes in data are very common and why we always explore, check and validate any data we are working on). We can clearly see this value is over 400 so we can use the which() function to identify which observation this is which(squid$nid.length &gt; 400). It looks like this is the 11th observation of the nid.length variable. Use your skill with the square brackets [ ] to first confirm the this is the correct value (you should get 430.2) and then change this value to 43.2. Now redo the dotchart to visualise your correction. Caution: You can only do this because you have confirmed that this is an transcribing error. You should not remove or change values in your data just because you feel like it or they look ‘unusual’. This is scientific fraud! Also, the advantage of making this change in your R script rather than in Excel is that you now have a permanent record of the change you made and can state a clear reason for the change. When exploring your data it is often useful to visualise the distribution of continuous variables. Take a look at the histogram section of this manual and then create histograms for the variables; DML, weight, eviscerate.weight and ovary.weight. Again, its up to you if you want to plot all 4 plots separately or in the same figure. Export your plot(s) as pdf file(s) to the output directory. One potential problem with histograms is that the distribution of data can look quite different depending on the number of ‘breaks’ used. The hist() function does it’s best to create appropriate ‘breaks’ for your plots (it uses the Sturges algorithm for those that want to know) but experiment with changing the number of breaks for the DML variable to see how the shape of the distribution changes. Scatterplots are great for visualising relationships between two continuous variables. Plot the relationship between DML on the x axis and weight on the y axis. How would you describe this relationship? Is it linear? One approach to linearising relationships is to apply a transformation on one or both variables. Try transforming the weight variable with either a natural log (log()) or square root (sqrt()) transformation. I suggest you create new variables in the squid dataframe for your transformed variables and use these variables when creating your new plots . Which transformation best linearises this relationship? Again, save your plots as a pdf file (or try saving in your output directory as jpeg or png format using the jpeg() or png() functions. When visualising differences in a continuous variable between levels of a factor (categorical variable) then a boxplot is your best friend (avoid using bar plots - Google ‘bar plots are evil’ for more info). Create a boxplot to visualise the differences in DML at each maturity stage (don’t forget to use the recoded version of this variable you created earlier in ii) . Include x and y axes labels in your plot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot. A violin plot is a combination of a boxplot and a kernel density plot and is great at visualising the distribution of a variable. To create a violin plot you will first need to install the vioplot package from CRAN and make it available using library(vioplot). You can now use the vioplot() function in pretty much the same way as you created your boxplot. To visualise the relationship between two continuous variables but for different levels of a factor variable you can create a conditional scatterplot. Use the coplot() function to plot the relationship between DML on the x axis and square root transformed weight on the y axis (you created this variable in vi) for each level of maturity stage. Does the relationship between DML and weight look different for each maturity stage (suggesting an interaction)? If you prefer, you can also create a similar plot using the xyplot() function from the lattice package. To explore the relationships between multiple continuous variables it’s hard to beat a pairs plot. Create a pairs plot for the variables; DML, weight, eviscerate.weight, ovary.weight, nid.length, and nid.weight. If it looks a little cramped in RStudio then click on the ‘zoom’ button in the plot viewer to see a larger version. One of the great things about the pairs() function is that you can customise what goes into each panel. Modify your pairs plot to include a histogram of the variables on the diagonal panel and include a correlation coefficient for each relationship on the upper triangle panels. Also include a smoother (wiggly line) in the lower triangle panels to help visualise these relationships. Almost every aspect of the figures you create in R is customizable. Learning how to get your plot looking just right is not only rewarding but also means that you will never have to include a plot in your paper/thesis that you’re not completely happy with. When you start learning how to use R it can sometimes seem to take a lot of work to customize your plots. Don’t worry, it gets easier with experience (most of the time anyway) and you will always have your code if you want to create a similar plot in the future. Use the plot() function to produce a scatterplot of DML on the x axis and ovary weight on the y axis (you might need to apply a transformation on the variable ovary.weight). Use a different colour to highlight points for each level of maturity stage. Produce a legend explaining the different colours and place it in a suitable position on the plot. Format the graph further to make it suitable for inclusion into your paper/thesis (i.e. add axes labels, change the axes scales etc). 10.4 4. Data Visualization with ggplot2 These exercises require you to generate plots of various kinds. This document shows both the plots that you should obtain and the solutions. Click on the Data Visualization with ggplot2 Answers Template to download the answers template to answer all the questions to this code challenge. 10.4.1 Part I – geoms and aesthetics These first few exercises will run through some of the simple principles of creating a ggplot2 object, assigning aesthetics mappings and geoms. Read in the cleaned patients dataset, patient-data-cleaned.txt, into a new object called patients using read_tsv() function. 10.4.2 Scatterplots Generate a scatterplot of BMI versus Weight using the patient dataset and add a colour scale based on the Height variable. Using an additional geom, add an extra layer of a fit line to the previous plot. Does the fit in the previous plot look good? Look at the help page for geom_smooth and adjust the method to fit a straight line without standard error bounds. 10.4.3 Boxplots and Violin plots Generate a boxplot of Score values comparing smokers and non-smokers. Split the previous boxplot into male and female groups with different colours. Produce a similar boxplot of Scores but this time group data by Sex and colour the interior of the box (not the outline) by Age. Change this plot to a violin plot. Note: Having loaded the data using read_tsv, the Age column has been set to dbl (short for double, a numeric vector type) as it only contains numbers. This makes it a continuous variable. In order to split the boxplot by age and colour each one according to Age, it is necessary to change age to be a categorical variable. We can do this by changing the Age column into a different vector type: a factor. 10.4.4 Histogram and Density plots Generate a histogram of BMIs with each bar coloured blue, choosing a suitable bin width. Instead of a histogram, generate a density plot of BMI Generate density plots of BMIs coloured by Sex. Hint: alpha can be used to control transparency. 10.4.5 Part II - facets In this next part you will create plots with faceting. First check that the cleaned patients dataset has been read in and is available as a data frame in your current session. If you haven’t done so, convert the Age variable to a factor. Using the patient dataset generate a scatterplot of BMI versus Weight, add a colour scale to the scatterplot based on the Height variable, and split the plot into a grid of plots separated by Smoking status and Sex. Generate a boxplot of BMIs comparing smokers and non-smokers, colour boxplot by Sex, and include a separate facet for people of different age. Produce a similar boxplot of BMIs but this time group data by Sex, colour by Age and facet by Smoking status. 10.4.6 Part III – scales and themes In these exercises we look at adjusting the scales and themes of our plots. Check that the cleaned patients dataset has been read in and is available as a data frame in your current session. Check also that the Age variable is a factor. 10.4.7 Scales Generate a scatterplot of BMI versus Weight from the patients dataset. Starting from the previous plot, adjust the BMI axis to show only labels for 20, 30, 40 and the weight axis to show breaks for 60 to 100 in steps of 5, adding the units (kilograms) to the axis label. Create a violin plot of BMI by Age where violins are filled using a sequential colour palette. Create a scatterplot of BMI versus Weight and add a continuous colour scale for the height. Make the colour scale with a midpoint (set to mean point) colour of grey and extremes of green (low) and red (high). 10.4.8 Themes Recreate the scatter plot of BMI by weight this time colouring by age group and add a straight line fit (but no standard error/confidence intervals) for each age group. Remove the legend title from the previous plot, change the background colours of legend keys to white and place the legend at the bottom of the plot. Add a title to the plot and remove the minor grid lines. Save the plot to a 7 by 7 inch image file. 10.5 5. Data Visualization using ggplot2 Part II Access the answers template here to answer all the questions. Plot a sin(x)/x using ggplot() function. Hint: Trigonometric functions in R use angles in radians (see ? sin). 2 times pi is 360 degrees. The ‘cars’ data set gives the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s. Plot the ‘cars’ data set as a scatter plot. Plot all data points with distances taken to stop greater than 80 in red. basic version with points Add color as a mapping that is only used by geom_points define the colors using a manual color scale add a second geom that produces a smoothed line (default is a local polynomial regression) "],["exercise-solutions.html", "Chapter 11 Exercise Solutions 11.1 Introduction to R and Data Visualization Exercises 11.2 R Base Graphics Exercises 11.3 Data Structures Relevant to Visualization Exercises 11.4 Customizing Graphs in Base R Exercises 11.5 Time Series Exercises 11.6 Statistical Graphs Exercises 11.7 GGPLOT2 Exercise", " Chapter 11 Exercise Solutions 11.1 Introduction to R and Data Visualization Exercises Exercise 1: Basic arithmetic Create a variable called \\(x\\) and give it the value 15.Take the exponent of the variable and add 5 to the final result.
