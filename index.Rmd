# Introduction to R and Data Visualization



## Introduction

### Overview of R 
R is a powerful programming language and environment widely used for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and it is highly extensible. R is freely available and runs on all major platforms, making it an excellent choice for data analysis and visualization.

With its extensive libraries, R enables users to manipulate data, conduct statistical analyses, and create visualizations to explore and communicate insights effectively. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, R provides a flexible and comprehensive environment for all your data analysis needs.


## Why Use R for Data Visualization?

### Advantages of R over other programming languages and tools.

- R has thousands of packages, designed, maintained, and widely used by statisticians.
- The R graphs have much more fun compared to other tools such as STATA.
- R has a rather liberal syntax, and variables don’t need to be
declared as they would in (for example) C++, which makes it very easy to
code in.
- R is designed to make it very easy to write functions which
are applied point wise to every element of a vector. This is extremely useful in statistics.
- R is powerful: if a command doesn’t exist already, you can code it yourself.



1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
