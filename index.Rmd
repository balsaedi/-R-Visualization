# INTRODUCTION TO R AND DATA VISUALIZATION


## Introduction

### Overview of R 
R is a powerful programming language and environment widely used for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and it is highly extensible. R is freely available and runs on all major platforms, making it an excellent choice for data analysis and visualization.

With its extensive libraries, R enables users to manipulate data, conduct statistical analyses, and create visualizations to explore and communicate insights effectively. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, R provides a flexible and comprehensive environment for all your data analysis needs.


## Why Use R for Data Visualization?

### Advantages of R over other programming languages and tools 

- R has thousands of packages, designed, maintained, and widely used by statisticians.
- The R graphs have much more fun compared to other tools such as STATA.
- R has a rather liberal syntax, and variables don’t need to be
declared as they would in (for example) C++, which makes it very easy to
code in.
- R is designed to make it very easy to write functions which
are applied point wise to every element of a vector. This is extremely useful in statistics.
- R is powerful: if a command doesn’t exist already, you can code it yourself.


###  R’s extensive package ecosystem 
A package is a collection (or library) of functions, datasets, and other objects. Most packages are not loaded automatically, so you have to do it yourself. **R's** extensive package ecosystem provides a vast array of tools for data analysis and visualization. These packages are contributed by a vibrant community of developers and cover almost every aspect of data science. Some of the most popular visualization packages include:

 i) **ggplot2:** The package provides an intuitive syntax for creating complex and beautiful visualizations.
 ii) **plotly:** This package allows one to create interactive web-based visualizations directly from R.
 iii) **ggvis:** It allows the creation of web-based visualizations with reactive features using the grammar of graphics syntax.
 iv) **lattice:** It is particularly useful for creating trellis plots, which allow you to visualize relationships in multivariate data.
 v) **gganimate:** The package allows you to easily add animations to your visualizations, making it ideal for exploring changes in data over time.
 
In this course, we will focus on the base R graphics system, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how plots are constructed in R. Once you have a good grasp of the basics, you can easily transition to more specialized packages like ggplot2 and plotly to create even more sophisticated visualizations.


## Installing and Configuring R and RStudio

Before installing **RStudio** in your computer, first start with **R**. **RStudio** is a front end program that lets you write **R** code, view plots, and do many other useful things. The detailed steps below show how to install R and RStudio in your computer system on both Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.


### Step-by-step guide on installing R 

1. Download the R installer from <https://cran.r-project.org/>.

  a). Click on the link for your operating system. Make sure the   installer is for the latest R version. For example, the latest version is 4.3.3.
  
  b). Click install R for the first time.
  
  c). Use the download link at the top and save the file.
  
2. Run the installer (double click), default settings are fine. 


### Step-by-step guide on installing RStudio and Set Up 

1. Wait until the R installer has finished.
2.Download RStudio installer from the official website <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.
3. After the download is complete, double-click on the installer and follow the installation steps to install it in your computer.


After successful installation, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking the RStudio icon on your desktop or from the Start menu. You can install the packages using the install.packages() function. However, for the base R visualization, you don't need to install any package which will support in plotting of graphs except where we you will be required to use data that comes with R packages. The last set up may be setting your working directory to the folder where your R scripts and data files are located. This makes it easier to access your files but it is optional.

## Basic R Concepts.

### Introduction to R syntax and basic commands 
R is  designed for statistical computing and graphics. In this section, we will cover some basic syntax and commands to help you get started with R.


**1. R as a Calculator:**

You can use R as a simple calculator. Here are some basic arithmetic operations:


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Addition
2 + 3
# Subtraction
5 - 2
# Multiplication
2 * 3
# Division
6 / 2
# Exponentiation
2^3

```

**2. Assigning Values to Variables:**

You can store values in variables using the assignment operator _<-_ or _=_.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x <- 5
y <- 3
# You can also use =
z = x + y

```

**3. Basic Data Types:**

R supports several basic data types, including numeric, character, logical, and complex.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Numeric
num <- 10
# Character
char <- "Hello, Basim!"
# Logical
logic <- TRUE
# Complex
comp <- 3 + 2i

```

**4. Vectors:**

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. You can create a vector using the **c()** function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Creating a numeric vector
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Creating a character vector
chars <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")

```

**5. Indexing and Slicing:**

You can access elements of a vector using square brackets **[]**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Accessing elements of a vector
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
nums[1]   # Access the first element of nums
nums[2:4] # Access the second to fourth elements of nums
nums[1,4,6] # Access the first, fourth and sixth elements of nums

```


**6. Functions:**

R has a large number of built-in functions, and you can also create your own functions for some tasks that can not be achieved by built-in functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Built-in function
sqrt(16)   # Square root function
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(nums) # the mean of nums elements
var(nums) # the variance
sd(nums) # standard deviation
# User-defined function
add <- function(a, b) {
  return(a + b)
}
add(3, 5)

```


### Overview of R’s data types and structures essential for visualization 

R provides several data types and structures that are essential for data visualization. Understanding these data types and structures is crucial for effectively analyzing and visualizing data.

**1. Numeric:**

Numeric data type is used to represent continuous numerical values.

```{r}
num <- 5.6

```

**2. Integer:**

Integer data type is used to represent integer values.

```{r}
int <- 10L

```

**3. Character:**

Character data type is used to represent text data.

```{r}
char <- "Hi, John!"

```

**4. Logical:**

Logical data type is used to represent Boolean values ( __TRUE__ or __FALSE__).

```{r}
logic <- TRUE

```

**5. Vector:**

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. It is created using the concatenate __c()__ command.  

```{r}
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # A vector of numeric data type
chars <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")  # A vector of character data type

```

**6. Matrix:**

A matrix is a two-dimensional array with rows and columns in that order respectively, that is ($R \times C$ ). It is created using the __matrix()__ command.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4) # A matrix with three rows and 2 columns 

```

**7. Data Frame:**

A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. It can contain several data types. It is created using the command __data.frame()__ command.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Height = c(175, 160, 180)
)

```

**8. List:**

A list is an ordered collection of objects (which may be of different types: numeric, character, etc.). It is created using the __list()__ command.

```{r}
lst <- list(
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Height = c(175, 160, 180)
)

```


**9. Factors:**

Factors are used to represent categorical data. It is created using the __factor()__ command.

```{r}
gender <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female"))
loan_default<-factor(c('Yes', 'No'))
```

## Practical Examples: Exercises

**Exercise 1: Basic arithmetic**

Create a variable called $x$ and give it the value 15.Take the exponent of the variable and add 5 to the final result. Print the final result of $x$.

```{r}
# Your code

```

**Exercise 2: Vectors:**

The weights of five people before and after a diet programme
are given in the table below. Read the ‘before’ and ‘after’ values into two different vectors called __before__
and __after__. Use __R__ to evaluate the amount of weight lost for each participant. What is the average amount of weight lost?


```{r, echo=FALSE}

  df=data.frame(
    X1 = c(78, 67),
    X2 = c(72, 65),
    X3 = c(78, 79),
    X4 = c(79, 70),
    X5 = c(105, 93)
  )
row.names(df)<-c("Before", "After")
colnames(df)<-NULL
knitr::kable(df, align = "c",booktabs = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#Your code
```



**Exercise 3: Matrices**

Create two matrices called __A__ and __X__ defined below. 
\[
A=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4 & 7 \\
2 & 5 & 8 \\
3 & 6 & 10 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
X=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&2&3\\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Find:

i) the product of __A__ and __X__.

ii) the transpose of __A__.

iii) the determinant of __A__.
iv) the diagonal of __A__.

v) the inverse of __A__.

```{r}
#Your code
```


**Exercise 4: Creating Data Frames**

(a) Create a small data frame representing a database of
films. It should contain the fields __title__, __director__, __year__, __country__, and at least three films.

(b) Create a second data frame of the same format as above, but containing just one new film.
(c) Merge the two data frames using rbind().
(d) Try sorting the titles using sort(): what happens?

```{r}
#Your code
```


**Exercise 5: Factors and Simple plot**

Suppose we have the heights of 100 individuals, where the first are 50 male and the rest female. Generate 100 fixed random numbers from a normal distribution where the mean height of male is 170 while that of female is 160 with an equal standard deviation of 10 and call that vector as 'height'. Create another vector called 'sex' with two entries 'M' and 'F' each replicated 50 times. Tell R to treat 'sex' as a categorical variable and name it as 'Sex'. Plot __Sex__ against __height__ using __plot()__ function. Which type of plot have you obtained? What happens if you try to plot __sex__ against __height__ instead?

```{r}
#Your code
```
